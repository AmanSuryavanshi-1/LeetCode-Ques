input [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
​
->Start iterating through the input vector nums using a traditional for loop with the index variable j:
​
1) Iteration 1 (j = 0):
i is at the beginning (i == 0),
the condition i == 0 is true.
Insert the current element nums[j], which is 0, at position i.
Increment i to 1.
​
2) Iteration 2 (j = 1):
i is now 1.
The condition i == 1 is true.
Insert the current element nums[j], which is 0, at position i.
Increment i to 2
​
3) Iteration 3 (j = 2):
i is now 2.
The condition nums[i - 2] != nums[j] is true because nums[0] is not equal to nums[2].
Insert the current element nums[j], which is 0, at position i.
Increment i to 3.
​
4) Iteration 4 (j = 3): Insert 1 at position i (increment i to 4).
5) Iteration 5 (j = 4): Insert 1 at position i (increment i to 5).
6) Iteration 6 (j = 5): Insert 1 at position i (increment i to 6).
7) Iteration 7 (j = 6): Insert 2 at position i (increment i to 7).
8) Iteration 8 (j = 7): Insert 2 at position i (increment i to 8).
9) Iteration 9 (j = 8): Insert 3 at position i (increment i to 9).
​
After the loop, the modified vector has [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]
