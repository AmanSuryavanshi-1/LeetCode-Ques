Count how many numbers are in the nums list.
Create a new collection that only keeps unique numbers from the nums list.
Count how many numbers are in this new collection.
If the count of all numbers in nums is greater than the count of unique numbers, it means there are duplicates, and the code returns true. Otherwise, if there are no duplicates, it returns false.
