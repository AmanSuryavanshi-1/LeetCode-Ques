The choice between using long long int and a single long depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your code. Here are the considerations:
​
Size Limitation:
​
A long variable typically has a size of 4 bytes (32 bits) on many systems, which limits its range.
A long long int variable, on the other hand, typically has a size of 8 bytes (64 bits), which provides a larger range.
Handling Large Numbers:
​
If you're working with very large integers that might exceed the range of a long, using a long long int is safer to avoid potential integer overflow.
A long variable might not be sufficient to handle the reversed number for extremely large input values.
